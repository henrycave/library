  nothing important..just something i always miss the chance to say     
  
  last time, i was going to talk to you more. but i ended up saying so much less than you. i felt sad and very disappointed at myself. 
  i’m so bad at talking and forgetful that i even put the things i wanted to say in notes. then i forgot to check my phone..i wanted 
  to tell you what i’m doing even though it’s lame. i wanted to know if you would like me to go shopping with you on your birthday. 
  i don’t want you to be alone on your bd unless that’s what you enjoy. or perhaps you’re going with your family or friends. in any case, 
  i regret that i didn’t say or ask. it’s like a lot of the times, i only know what i wanted to say after days. or just said it in a 
  slient way somehow. like when you said about people enjoying the work they do. i wondered if cybersecurity is what you enjoy to do. 
  what is your favourite course if there's one and the least favourite? what are the things you like to do other than soccer. and 
  when you said about gorge and prostitutes..i was thinking if prostitution is legal in canada.. i don't know why i just started to 
  talk internally instead of saying out lound sometimes..strange... i guess i can see your disappointments now because i do too.

  i wanted to tell you that i want to start learning soccer if you could teach me again even the weather is bad, even there’s no time, 
  even we’re stuck. i’ll find a way. that’s the only thing i’m good at, but i don’t know if i’m still good at it this time. i wanted 
  to ask if you would like me to visit you in cuba for a few days because i want to spend more time with you, just for a little while. 
  i wanted to tell you that i want to go back “home” too but i’ll wait for you till you leave. i wanted to ask when you said you used 
  to go to the parking lot, was it when you miss home? because i felt your sadness a long time ago. it felt familiar, but i wasn’t sure. 
  so i gave you the “easy revenge” anyway. and it turned to another thing. magic? is it because i felt like i know you without talking 
  to you? it felt like i know you a longtime ago(reversed now?). is this also why no matter how many barriers, i still 
  finished printing “Adios, Eri”? since i succeeded in printing it eventually, i wanted to see if it's magic or just an adios.
  
  you asked me when i started feeling more. it was when you just sitting next to me talking about your past, cuba, soccer and everything 
  else, and i felt your sadness even stronger because you were so happy before. and i also liked that when you saying nothing but just
  sitting next to me on the bench. i felt very quiet and safe around you (and i’m really sorry that it seems like i always put you in danger). 
  i guess i like staying with you, having you beside me, for some time. but it's kinda unpleasing to find this as it seems quite demanding if 
  that's not what you like. and i felt you can get me when we played at the escape room. did i get you too? then i like your hugs, very tight 
  but also very light, and you burried your head in my neck and shoulder. i felt warm when you said you miss me and like me a lot. so i also 
  wanted to do things that can make you feel warm since i’m so bad with talking. i like that you held my arm and fell asleep on my arm. i wish 
  that could wash away all your headaches. but i guess you’re very very tired now.so am i. but afterall, it must be very boring and cold sitting 
  next to a stone like me..(and all of sudden, it started to talk???the magic of evolution?)....
  
  i also want you to know that you can tell me whatever, your bad feelings, tried of lot, assignments, everything is a bullshit. i feel you. 
  i thought about the things you told me about coming to a new place,inevitably hard. is that because we can't go back to the old places?not
  in a phyical sense. but where to go? couple days ago, my friend sent me some pictures of the furnitures she got for her new home. she told 
  me that only those things will stay till the end. i started to wonder if home is just a feeling.very hard to grasp..i watched a documentary 
  about a girl recording her dad's last days. the dad got a malignant tumor. it spread out very quickly, so he went to the states to see
  his son and granddaughters. he also went to places he always wanted to go and ate the food he always wanted to try. he was very very happy.
  he never spent this much time with the family.he worked very hard when he was young because he enjoyed his work so much. he was very happy 
  when he retired and thought he could finally enjoy his life till finding out the cancer. but he still did the things he wanted and planned 
  to do, with more. in his last month, everyone came, the family was there, the dad stayed till the very last end,as long as he could. he said 
  all he could said, so leaving no one with regrets. still did, no matter how hard they tried..i guess it's very fortunate to have family like 
  this unfortunate life we have. i think i learnt something from it. i think i also learnt some from you too. but i still don't know how..
  like the dad before dying. a little off topic..if there're any topics here....i guess i was going to say if i’m not good at talking, then i’m 
  sorta good at listening i suppose. but i also know that you’re in a certain zone when the mood comes. last week, when you said you were stressed 
  and in a bad mood, the memory of hd came across my mind. when i first came out doing lot, you told me that you didn’t want to talk to me because 
  you were mad and didn’t want to talk to me like that. sorry i should’ve known. i guess i always know. it's just that i only knew what condition
  you were in till you told me. i was also a little sad about the fact that you could tell everyone else but me, even though i know you didn’t want 
  your mood to affect me. i don’t mind the bad mood side of you. but all of this is just very egocentric to say. i guess i’m a bit the same sometimes.
  so i wonder, will you mind if i let you know my feelings? like now.
  
  i've been worrying that my time here is a little unclear.it might just be not the right time, perhaps very wrong, so am i. i’m so 
  sorry that i didn't say things in the right time and saying it in the wrong time when i know it's probably the wrong time(still a stone?
  very ignorant..) and being very mean, without noticing, even worse…(but i guess you've successfully inherited my meanness, can i say we're 
  a little bit fair now on that part?).i've been thinking, would things be different if i knew them ealier.no idea but i've also been worrying 
  that we live our lives in the confines of fear. so last friday i really wanted to tell you the things i said here, but of course i’m very
  bad with time too. i should've said it the last time i saw you. but when is a good time to ever say or do anything?very tricky.
    
  if i start running a bit faster now, will i be able to score? but i can't run nor stop. sometimes the ball hits my face. i want to leave 
  the field. i don't want to score. i don't want to win either. but other people want to win. so i have to keep playing. why are they never 
  satisfied?  i keep on learning. 

    
  
  i’m either too slow or too fast, either saying too little or too much. so i just laugh about it. this is becoming a very long comedy now, 
  too long. i suppose we can laugh about it together, for a long time or at another time when the time is right. 


    
  buenas noches.

He was a shy man who was uncomfortable in society and avoided it when he could. He could speak to only one person at a time, and only if the person were known to him and male.[33] He conversed little, always dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and developed no known deep personal attachments outside his family. Cavendish was taciturn and solitary and regarded by many as eccentric. He communicated with his female servants only by notes. By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house to avoid encountering his housekeeper, because he was especially shy of women. The contemporary accounts of his personality have led some modern commentators, such as Oliver Sacks, to speculate that he was autistic.[34]

His only social outlet was the Royal Society Club, whose members dined together before weekly meetings. Cavendish seldom missed these meetings, and was profoundly respected by his contemporaries. However, his shyness made those who "sought his views... speak as if into vacancy. If their remarks were...worthy, they might receive a mumbled reply, but more often than not they would hear a peeved squeak (his voice appears to have been high-pitched) and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish fleeing to find a more peaceful corner".[15] Cavendish's religious views were also considered eccentric for his time. He was considered to be agnostic. As his biographer, George Wilson, comments, "As to Cavendish's religion, he was nothing at all."[35][36]

The arrangement of his residence reserved only a fraction of space for personal comfort as his library was detached, the upper rooms and lawn were for astronomical observation and his drawing room was a laboratory with a forge in an adjoining room.[37] He also enjoyed collecting fine furniture, exemplified by his purchase of a set of "ten inlaid satinwood chairs with matching cabriole legged sofa".[38]

Because of his asocial and secretive behaviour, Cavendish often avoided publishing his work, and much of his findings were not told even to his fellow scientists. In the late nineteenth century, long after his death, James Clerk Maxwell looked through Cavendish's papers and found observations and results for which others had been given credit. Examples of what was included in Cavendish's discoveries or anticipations were Richter's law of reciprocal proportions, Ohm's law, Dalton's law of partial pressures, principles of electrical conductivity (including Coulomb's law), and Charles's Law of gases. A manuscript "Heat", tentatively dated between 1783 and 1790, describes a "mechanical theory of heat". Hitherto unknown, the manuscript was analysed in the early 21st century. Historian of science Russell McCormmach proposed that "Heat" is the only 18th-century work prefiguring thermodynamics. Theoretical physicist Dietrich Belitz concluded that in this work Cavendish "got the nature of heat essentially right".[39]

As Cavendish performed his famous density of the Earth experiment in an outbuilding in the garden of his Clapham Common estate, his neighbours would point out the building and tell their children that it was where the world was weighed.[38]
